## What is IE6Bar?
IE6Bar is a small widget that is meant for owners of websites that do not offer support for the Internet Explorer 6 browser anymore.
As soon as you place the widget on your website, it will show up to users that still use this old browser to visit your sites.
The bar notifies these users that they should upgrade to obtain support.

If an user finds the bar annoying, he or she can simply click the close button.
After doing this, the bar will hide itself and place a cookie to remember it should not show up anymore to this user.
